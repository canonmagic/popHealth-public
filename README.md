# PopHealth

popHealth is an open source tool that allows healthcare providers to calculate quality measures. A quality measure is a calculation of the number of individuals in a population that meet a specific standard of care.

popHealth can import patient summaries in either [QRDA Cat I](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=35) or [C-CDA](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=379) format. popHealth will extract information from the patient summaries and calculate quality reports.
